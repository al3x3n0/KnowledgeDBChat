Provide: (1) read/skim/skip decision, (2) 3 key claims, (3) 3 risks/unknowns, (4) suggested follow-ups.\n\nABSTRACT:\nWe introduce CacheSight, a profiling method that infers cache miss sources by combining sampled hardware counters with binary-level control-flow graphs. Across 18 workloads, CacheSight identifies the top-3 miss-generating code regions with 0.82 precision and reduces investigation time by 35% compared to manual counter inspection. We integrate with existing profilers and evaluate overhead under 2%.\n"

Provide: decision + rationale + what would convince you.\n\nNOTE:\nWe propose replacing the current ranking feature in our internal search with a learned reranker trained on click logs. Early offline tests on a 2-week sample show +3.2% NDCG@10 but the dataset may be biased due to seasonal traffic and missing negative examples. Inference latency target is <15ms at p95, but the prototype currently hits 28ms.\n"
