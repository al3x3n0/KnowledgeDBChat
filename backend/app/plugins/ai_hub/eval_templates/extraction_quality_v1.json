The kernel was Linux 6.6. We compiled with GCC 13.2 using -O3.\nWorkload: a Monte Carlo simulation (10^8 iterations). We pinned to a single NUMA node and disabled turbo.\nMetric: runtime (seconds), averaged over 10 runs; we report mean and stddev.\nResult: baseline 12.4s ±0.2; patched 11.1s ±0.1 (~10.5% speedup).\nControl: Verified identical input seeds and CPU affinity; collected perf stat for cycles/instructions.\n"
